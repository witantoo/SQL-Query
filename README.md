# SQL-Query
This project used mySQL to process and analyze on the input data. This project, contains some basic-advanced query, create view, and some stored procedure that used to search data, calculation, and solve some problem by query. The main goal in this project, is for pratice by implement DML, view, and stored procedure to analyze and get needed data.

Step:
1. Use DDL to create database with "CREATE DATABASE \<database name>" command.
2. after create the database dont forget to use the database and create the table with "CREATE TABLE \<table_name>(...)". There's 6 table in total with different collumn, data type, and requirement.
3. Insert data to the table with "INSERT INTO table_name(table_collumn) VALUES(...)".
4. Use DML to obtain the required data. There alot command in DML like SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, WHERE, LIKE, and more. 
5. To use view, you need to create the view first and select it with SELECT view_name.
6. To use stored procedure, you need to put DELIMETER first and create the procedure, and don't forget to end and close the delimeter. After create the stored procedure, use "CALL \<stored procedure name>" to get the data.
